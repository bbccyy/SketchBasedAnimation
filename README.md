I'm going to turn this program into a Javascript based project.

need to install: Glut
Run program directly.
Notes: 

1) Creating function needs an anticlockwise stroke;
   Do not make intersection on your strokes;
   After stroking, click mouse mid-key to get the menu and then slecet CREATING;
   Click right mouse key to show and display the object.  
 
2) Painting function needs one or several strokes you want on the screen;
   No need directly on the object;
   After stroking, get menu and select PAINTING;
   Click right mouse key to show and display the painting strokes.

3) Erasing function needs one or several strokes you want on the target surface painting;
   Make sure there are overlap between them;
   You can erase several painting once at a time;
   Click right mouse key to show and display the remaining painting strokes.

4) Extrusion function needs two strokes in order;
   First anticlockwise stroke need directly on the object where you want the extrusion be;
   Second stroke makes the extrusion shape on one side;
   After two stroking, get menu and select EXTRUSION;
   Click right mouse key to show and display the extrusion.

5) Cutting function needs one stroke on any object;
   The region will be removed is on the left side of your oriented stroke;
   For example, you draw up and down, the direction is towards downside,
   So remove the right part of the line;
   After stroking, get menu and select CUTTING;
   Click right mouse key to show and display the remaining objects after cutting.

6) Undo function just help to delete strokes on the screen that you think they are incorrect.

7) Switch function switch from a mesh view to a surface view.

There may be some bugs, if the system stucked, re-run it and try to avoid illegal operation.
Enjoy it!
